This is simple project to detect human frontal faces in images or videos live and draws a box around them. It uses Haar-Cascades from OpenCV so to run the programs you need to download OpenCV.

1) Use detect.py to test an image or a video with human faces, by passing the image or the video file as an argument, use the entire path if the source image is in a different directory.
Example : python detect.py myimage.jpg
